I handled the project in 4 different stages; Cleaning the data, standardizing the data, exploring the data and sharing the findings.
Cleaning the data; Went over every each columns. Removed duplicates, changed entries on gender column and made changes on commute distance column to make things easy for pivot tables.
Standardizing the data; Made a new column named age brackets. Divided ages to three brackets. 
Exploring the data; Made pivot tables and played a bit to see what the data tell us. 
Sharing the findings; Created a dashboard from pivot tables I found interesting.
